C. Finding Minimums
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes

You are given N numbers, and you should divide them into consecutive groups of size K, then print the minimum among each group. If the last group is of size <K, print the minimum number found just after the last number received.

For more explanation, see the notes.

Input
First line contains two numbers N,K (1≤K≤N≤105) – the number of values, and the range length after which you should print the minimum.

Second line contains N numbers (−109≤x≤109).

Output
Print the answer in a single line.

Note
In the first test case:

The minimum number among [4,−1,2] is −1.
The minimum number among [3,5,0] is 0.
The minimum number among [2,7] is 2.

In the second test case:

The minimum number among [4,−1,2,3] is −1.
The minimum number among [5,0,2,7] is 0.
